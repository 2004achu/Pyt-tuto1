Input: Taking 4 integers from the user
numbers = []
for i in range(4):
    num = int(input(f"Enter integer {i + 1}: "))
    numbers.append(num)

 Initialize sums and counts
sum_positive = 0
sum_negative = 0
count_positive = 0
count_negative = 0

 Loop through the numbers to calculate the sum and count for positive and negative numbers
for num in numbers:
    if num > 0:
        sum_positive += num
        count_positive += 1
    elif num < 0:
        sum_negative += num
        count_negative += 1

 Calculate the averages
average_positive = sum_positive / count_positive if count_positive > 0 else 0
average_negative = sum_negative / count_negative if count_negative > 0 else 0

 Output the results
print(f"Sum of posi
