Input: Taking the coordinates of the point
x = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate: "))
y = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate: "))

 Determine the quadrant or location
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    print("The point is in Quadrant I.")
elif x < 0 and y > 0:
    print("The point is in Quadrant II.")
elif x < 0 and y < 0:
    print("The point is in Quadrant III.")
elif x > 0 and y < 0:
    print("The point is in Quadrant IV.")
elif x == 0 and y != 0:
    print("The point is on the Y-axis.")
elif y == 0 and x != 0:
    print("The point is on the X-axis.")
else:
    print("The point is at the Origin.")
